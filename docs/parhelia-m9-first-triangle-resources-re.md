# M9 first-triangle context and resource closure

This note reconstructs the saved resource prerequisites around the already
decoded two-pass M9148 triangle.  It is limited to offline captures and the
saved Linux and Windows vendor binaries.  No packet in this work was submitted
to hardware.  Reproduce every numeric claim with:

```sh
python3 tools/m9-first-triangle-resources-evidence.py --self-test
```

The verifier pins the complete input files and the instruction-aligned binary
slices used below.  The raw fixed-function archive has SHA-256
`49859ba73319efd6d967e2a873aa6508b1de7eccfeb026508cd10bf35317d2c2`.

## The 80-slot context image

Startup sequences 0, 8, 10, and 14 in the settled `gltri` capture contain the
same 80 two-dword native slots.  The payload is exactly `0x280` bytes and has
SHA-256:

```text
78434eea53365d762f7eda163d5981ab765d754d1bed9e5377ed231e30bc34fb
```

Every slot is emitted in its own three-write indexed packet.  For slot `i`:

```text
8f = 80000000 + (i / 8) * 40
data ports = 90 + 2*(i % 8), 91 + 2*(i % 8)
```

The 80 `{selector,port,lo,hi}` records have SHA-256
`4fa0c712c862b15ad0f5195d7926f3de00600fef0c834ba96ce3372d58ac1593`.
The four byte-identical uploads prove that this is invariant context state,
not an application shader selected by `6c`.  Sequence 0 also records the full
surrounding transition and ordinary-state envelope.  The exact image and its
packet grammar are therefore closed; the smallest subset of the surrounding
envelope that is safe after a cold reset remains a hardware-isolation
question.  A first kernel-owned diagnostic should reproduce the complete
sequence-0 setup envelope instead of uploading the `0x280` bytes in isolation.

## Canonical vertex allocation and accessed bytes

Allocation result 40 in the preserved fixed-function archive describes the
canonical vertex arena:

| field | value |
| --- | ---: |
| GPU base at allocation result `+0x208` | `40f52000` |
| byte extent at `+0x218` | `00192700` |
| dimensions at `+0x198/+0x19c` | `3fc0 x 65` |

The fixed-function lighting triangle binds `00=40f52101`, `10=18`, and H03
`[0,4)`.  Removing the low address tag gives the exact accessed byte interval:

```text
arena + 0x100 .. arena + 0x160     (four records * 0x18 bytes)
```

The original float2 `gltri` draw binds `00=40f52001`, `10=14`, H03 `[0,4)`,
so its interval is `arena + 0 .. arena + 0x50`.  Index `10` is a per-element
record span, not the total source byte count.

For the original flat green `gltri`, the declaration under repeated index `23`
is exactly:

```text
00100dac 00100236 02200d88 02200ab6 00004b08 0 0 0
```

The same `0x14` span/declaration exists in the controlled M9148 topology
corpus, whose `SHA256SUMS` manifest hashes to
`fc30144d2f472b6f07213908daf4d7fc7de62a7927fb54060c4b257c47acb48d`.
Two independent M0528 CPU-ring captures expose the corresponding payload:
flat hashes to `b3f3086104deec1ec9aa1c3819109eb8abbd20e2376542a5706d4a75ff5cba0b`
and Gouraud to
`7bfcfd077ba4d8eae30821df6155d0f73420ba794efe45dd4fcdb2887b0f8fcd`.
Their source records are exactly five little-endian
float32 values in `{x,y,r,g,b}` order.  Current color is copied into every
record; it is not carried only in state.  The default-green bounded source is:

```text
20,20,0,1,0   300,20,0,1,0   160,220,0,1,0
```

M9148 preprocessing reads four records although raster launches `[0,3)`.  A
clean-room producer must initialize that entire read window.  Duplicating the
third record into record four gives this exact 80-byte diagnostic image:

```text
SHA-256 58bd76a39629399e0da5241acea797223c6b68c8eaf83dec7161a6e095845f3a
```

The fourth record is deterministic safe padding, not a claim about bytes left
there by the vendor allocator.  It cannot affect the three-element raster
launch.  This closes source construction for the flat first triangle and gives
the clean-room rule for the captured float2/current-RGB layout.  The other
captured canonical layouts remain usable through their documented repackers;
arbitrary direct VBO layouts remain outside this diagnostic.

## C2/C3 common resource

The exported float3 draw uses `c2=11f61000,c3=4` in preprocessing and
`c2=11f61000,c3=0` in raster.  A separate run of the same fixture returns the
matching base in allocation result 52:

```text
GPU base    11f61000
extent      00001080 bytes
dimensions  00000400 x 1
```

The next identical allocation returns `11f63000`, proving a page-rounded
`0x2000` reservation for the `0x1080` logical object.  Both command passes bind
the allocation base directly, with no leading page or address tag.  The
separate process histories establish the allocation and command ABI, but must
not be treated as one allocation-to-draw timeline.

Linux emitter `m9x29970` at `0x4ae4ed..0x4ae55b` emits header `c2,c3`, takes
the resource pair at state `+0x148`, and registers two views through the same
relocation callback:

```text
packet slot 2, usage 13
packet slot 3, usage 14
```

Its null-resource branch at `0x4ae62f..0x4ae68c` emits the adjacent `e6/e3`
transition and literal `c2=4,c3=0` form.  Consequently `c2/c3` are a common
resource-bank transition with two resource usages; index identity alone does
not say whether a given value is an address or literal.  The narrow hardware
read/write direction of usages `0x13/0x14` is still unavailable, so retain the
0x1080-byte object for the complete job and declare it read/write in the first
diagnostic.

The raw archive does not settle initialization.  Allocation 52 belongs to
process 5644; the exported draw and its preceding fence-only submits belong to
process 5632.  The same-process submit after allocation 52 contains only the
literal null C2 form.  Neither process saved a C2 payload or trapped CPU stores
through the mapped local aperture.  Any vendor initial bytes can therefore
come from an earlier CPU aperture store or allocator policy.  A guarded
diagnostic should zero all `0x1080` bytes and treat C2 as a job-local read/write
object.  This is a deterministic probe policy, not proof that zero matches the
missing vendor image; exact initial C2 bytes remain an evidence gap if the
probe does not complete correctly.  The complete corrected provenance is in
`parhelia-m9-c2-backing-re.md`.

## BE auxiliary surface resource

Linux surface emitter `m9x12791` tests dirty bit `0x800`, emits header `be`,
passes the resource pair at surface shadow `+0xd0`, and invokes its relocation
callback with usage `8` (`0x4b08de..0x4b0939`).  This proves raster `be` is a
relocated auxiliary member of the bound surface state.  Preprocess `be=3` is
the literal alternate form.

The Windows producer closes the resource's allocation boundary.  Raw
configuration constructor `0xb94e8..0xb9528` creates the `TempBufferSize`
entry at object `+0x68` with default `0x400`.  The derived configuration
wrapper at `0x60613..0x60638` carries that same entry into device slot
`+0x230`.  Snapshot constructor `0xbe425..0xbe44c` reads it and computes:

```text
snapshot +0x88 = TempBufferSize << 12       = 0x400000
snapshot +0x8c = (snapshot[+0x88] + 3) / 4 = 0x100000
```

The shifts establish that the option counts 4-KiB units.  The independent
Linux derived-configuration constructor `m9x5653` stores the same two values
at `+0x84=0x400000` and `+0x88=0x100000`
(`0x297b68..0x297b7b`).  Its raw option constructor at
`0x32f828..0x32f87f` also names `TempBufferSize` and supplies default `0x400`.

The Linux producer provides a direct same-binary join to the emitter.  Cold
context setup `m9x17919` passes configuration `+0x84` to vtable method `+0x70`
and keeps that 4-MiB resource at setup `+0xd0`.  It then passes configuration
`+0x88` to vtable method `+0x78`, keeps the returned 1-MiB resource at setup
`+0xd8`, and calls `m9x3202` (`0x3b6f90`) to install it in current state
`+0x8a` (`0x461c2b..0x461c98`).  Lowerer `m9x11630` reads current state
`+0x8a`, calls resource method `+0x40` with selector `0x0d`, copies the result
to surface shadow `+0xd0/+0xd8`, and sets the byte representation of dirty bit
`0x800` (`0x3f02c7..0x3f034f`).  Emitter `m9x12791` then consumes this exact
shadow pair with relocation usage `8`.

The Windows context object installs vtable `0x1f3850`; entries `+0x34` and
`+0x38` are factories `0x75eb0` and `0x75ff0`.  Cold setup first passes
snapshot `+0x88` to `+0x34` and retains the resulting 4-MiB resource at setup
`+0x68`.  It then passes snapshot `+0x8c` to `+0x38`, retains the result at
setup `+0x6c`, and calls setter `0x109090` to install it in current state
`+0x6c` (`0x11c0fa..0x11c14c`).  These are separate resources; the second one
is BE.

Factory `0x75ff0` transforms its byte request as follows:

```text
elements = ceil(request / 4)
width    = 0x400 32-bit elements
height   = ceil(elements / 0x400)
depth    = 1
levels   = 1
internal format = 0x0a
```

For the default request, `elements=0x40000` and `height=0x100`, so the logical
backing is exactly `0x400 * 0x100 * 4 = 0x100000` bytes.  The factory calls the
common allocator at `0xa3870` and returns its `+0x30` resource interface.  The
interface vtable is installed at `0xa334a`; its method `+0x1c` reaches the
resource selector at `0xa95d0 -> 0xa6740`.  Public selector `0x0d` selects
internal view `0x0f`.  This is the same method and selector used by the BE
lowerer at `0x1828c5..0x182936`, which copies the returned address/backing pair
to surface shadow `+0x8c/+0x90` while preserving the high tag bits, then sets
dirty bit `0x800`.  That joins the option, allocation, current-state slot,
surface shadow, Linux relocation usage, and final `be` command value.

The captured M9148 address boundary corroborates the constructor exactly:

```text
raster BE base                 0x112c1000
first preprocessing transient 0x113c1000
difference                     0x00100000 bytes
```

The captured GPU-address fields therefore reserve exactly the requested 1 MiB
before the next internal resource.  All 54 allocation results in the preserved
raw archive are later client allocations; none has base `0x112c1000`.  This is
why the wrapper did not save a BE allocation result or content snapshot: BE
was already owned by the context.

The lifetime is also closed.  Setup-to-current-state clone
`0x11bd84..0x11bda1` reinstalls both temporary resources, including setup
`+0x6c` through setter `0x109090`.  Context cleanup
`0x11c3ee..0x11c41e` decrements the BE reference, destroys it on the final
reference, and clears setup `+0x6c`; outer context destruction reaches this
cleanup from `0x11bbe0`.  Linux independently performs the same reference
decrement/destruction and clears setup `+0xd8` at
`0x4615ef..0x461623`.  BE is consequently one private resource per context,
not a per-draw transient.

There is no explicit CPU payload write or GPU fill between the `0xa3870`
allocation call and the initial BE bind in the traced cold-setup path.  The
saved wrapper has no image of the context-private allocation, so it cannot
distinguish fresh zeroed storage from an allocator zeroing policy.  The related
M0528 MMIO trace with SHA-256
`8fa1b88deda8cedd8a747c17669e8ad6ace7c408d754a0687e4165321b9aabd6`
provides independent initialization corroboration: one `rep stosq` run zeros
every aperture qword from `d1120000` through `d112fff8`.  M0528 local command
addresses use 16-byte units, placing its `be=112c1000` at aperture byte
`d112c100`; at least `0x3f00` bytes from that related-family BE base are
observed zero.

The clean-room M9148 rule is now precise: allocate a distinct, page-aligned
`0x100000`-byte read/write BO when creating the 3D context; zero the complete
BO once before its first possible submission; bind its selector-13 address
through surface-shadow BE and relocation usage `8`; never alias it with the
four preprocessing transients; and release it only after all jobs from that
context have retired.  Full zeroing is a deterministic clean-room and
information-disclosure policy.  It does not claim knowledge of missing vendor
bytes, and no opaque initialization image is required.  The historical M9148
allocator's exact initial contents remain unrecorded, but they are no longer an
implementation dependency.

## AB, AC, and AE are packed surface state

Linux `m9x12791` at `0x4b0b77..0x4b0bc9` copies surface-shadow dwords
`+0x20,+0x24,+0x30` directly to indices `ab,ac,ae` when dirty bit `0x200` is
set.  These are ordinary indexed values and have no relocation callback.

Windows `MxMD.dll` closes their producer.  The complete relevant function
prefix is VA `0x181fa0..0x182455`; the AB/AC block is
`0x1824b6..0x182549`.  Let each four-byte device descriptor be `d`.  The loop
performs:

```text
source = d & 0xffff
if source != 0xfffe:
    slot = ((((d >> 16) & 0x3f) - 0x10) >> 2)
    halfword[slot] = surface_halfword_table[source]  # object +0x1a0
AB = halfword[1] << 16 | halfword[0]
AC = halfword[3] << 16 | halfword[2]
```

The prologue allocates `0x28` stack bytes but never initializes the four local
halfwords before the descriptor-directed stores.  This is visible in the
captures: all twenty independently executed topology cases have
`AB[15:0]=ffff`, while all twenty upper 48-bit values differ.  Those inactive
slots are vendor stack residue, not surface layout.  For the bounded one-RT
triangle, initialize all four halfwords to `ffff` and overwrite every active
descriptor destination using the formula above.  The resulting deterministic
single-RT value is `AB=ffffffff,AC=ffffffff`, which the vendor already emits in
the preprocessing pass.  Arbitrary MRT still requires construction of each
active entry in the per-surface halfword table.

At `0x1822e1..0x18230a`, AE is copied from object `+0x1b8`, optionally with bit
28 set for one device mode.  AB/AC/AE remain ordinary state and must never be
relocated.

## Four preprocessing transients

Both the original float2 triangle and the independent float3 fixed-function
triangle use the same bases:

```text
113c1000  113d7800  113ee000  11404800
```

All three adjacent differences are exactly `0x16800`.  Preprocessing writes
them through `[b0,b2,b4,b8]`; raster reads them in the exact permutation
`[00,03,01,02]`, equivalent to the canonical join `[b0,b4,b8,b2] ->
[00,01,02,03]`.  Their descriptors are also invariant in the saved ordinary
cases.

The capture proves the address lattice and the full-job read/write lifetime.
It does not prove that each base is a distinct allocation rather than a
suballocation of one server arena, and no between-pass contents snapshot was
saved.  For a guarded diagnostic, allocate four independent objects with at
least `0x16800` writable bytes each, preserve their alignment requirements,
and place an inaccessible or sentinel guard after that conservative writable
extent.  This reproduces at least the spacing available to the first three
vendor views; it is a diagnostic allocation policy, not a claim that
`0x16800` is the hardware's minimum or exact logical stream size.  Treat any
guard access as a failed bound and stop.

## Linked-record cold-context rule

The GLSL A/B/A fixture saves the system allocation at `40c3a000`, allocation
extent `0x20080`, and `0x21000`-byte snapshots.  Linked records A and B begin
at offsets `0x300` and `0x880`, giving adjacent `0x580`-byte slots.  The
verifier scans every aligned dword in both slots of sequences 15, 19, and 23.
After clearing the documented low tag bits, no value points into either:

```text
captured local aperture       10000000..1fffffff
captured system allocation    40c3a000..40c5a07f
```

Thus the captured programmable A/B slots have an empty embedded GPU-BO pointer
relocation map.  This result does **not** permit copying arbitrary opaque slots.

The fixed-function draw selects `6c=40c3b601`, hence the `0x580`-byte slot at
system offset `0x1600`.  Its SHA-256 is
`356476b633ed3efcf8f23f9ef39bb9cbf30c2654a47a79ec9111b5b5b2081335`.
It embeds nine 64-bit process addresses at slot offsets `80,98,c8,f8,198,1b0,
1c8,1e0,1f8`; their values are `00002b9481be8970` or
`00002b948257fed8`, matching the capture process' `0x2b94...` address space.
These are not GPU BO pointers, but they are necessarily stale after a cold
process/context transition.

Therefore raw fixed-slot replay is rejected.  A cold diagnostic must bind only
a newly serialized record owned by the current context.  The statically
documented selector-`68` fixed-chain path is a possible replacement after its
selection relation to this captured two-pass draw is validated; it cannot yet
be substituted merely because its image format is known.  A verifier that
checks only GPU apertures is insufficient.  General programmable rendering
still needs the linked-pair byte serializer.

## Updated first-triangle boundary

Closed from saved evidence:

* exact 80-slot bytes, selector/port grammar, and equality across four uploads;
* canonical vertex arena extent, exact source windows, and an exact 80-byte
  flat-green source/repacker contract;
* C2 backing extent, paired static usages, and absence of a GPU initializer;
* BE's exact 1-MiB M9148 extent, configuration/factory derivation, selector-13
  bind, context lifetime, and deterministic full-zero clean-room policy;
* exact AB/AC descriptor formula and deterministic one-RT initialization;
* exact transient address lattice, join, and conservative guarded probe size;
* rejection of raw fixed linked-record replay due to embedded host addresses.

Still required before the first validated triangle executes:

* exact initial C2 bytes if deterministic zero initialization does not work;
* between-pass transient content semantics, if the conservative `0x16800`
  guard test fails;
* a current-context linked-pair serializer, or validation that the inline
  fixed-chain path selects the required two-pass program.

For archival completeness, the vendor M9148 allocator's pre-use BE bytes were
not captured.  Static construction shows no explicit payload initializer, and
the related M0528 stack zeros the containing range.  Since the clean-room rule
zeros the entire exact extent and relies on no unknown payload, this missing
historical image is not a bring-up gap.
