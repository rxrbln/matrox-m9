# M9/Phoenix recovery-surface audit

This note closes a narrow static-analysis question: whether the saved M9 Linux
core or Windows miniport contains a requester/3D timeout recovery or global
engine reset outside the already-audited interrupt paths.  Addresses below are
virtual addresses in `MxMM.sys` and `.text` offsets in
`KernelLibraries.o_shipped`.  `[BIN]` is a direct binary observation and
`[DER]` is a conclusion from joined observations.

## Windows miniport callback surface

`DriverEntry` at `0x55e05` builds the 0x54-byte legacy
`VIDEO_HW_INITIALIZATION_DATA` used by `VideoPortInitialize` [BIN].  The
function pointers are:

| structure offset | entry point | role |
|---:|---:|---|
| `+0x08` | `0x55ebd` | find adapter |
| `+0x0c` | `0x56304` | initialize |
| `+0x10` | `0x10875` | interrupt |
| `+0x14` | `0x58805` | StartIO |
| `+0x20` | `0x10505` | ResetHw |
| `+0x24` | `0x5676f` | child descriptor |
| `+0x28` | `0x57690` | get power state |
| `+0x2c` | `0x576e7` | set power state |
| `+0x30` | `0x588ad` | query interface |

The value at `+0x18` is the `0xc828` device-extension size, not another
callback.  The image imports `VIDEOPRT.SYS`/`VideoPortInitialize` and contains
no `Dxgk` import or string.  It is an XPDM miniport and exposes no WDDM
timeout-reset callback [BIN].

### `HwResetHw` is a display reset

`HwResetHw` at `0x10505` first checks device-ready bytes `+0x76/+0x77`, calls
`0x124d8`, and updates display-state bytes `+0x78/+0x79` [BIN].  Its remaining
calls are exactly:

```text
0x11b73  obtain/check device+4 -> display-manager +0x1ec
0x11bb2  read a display descriptor
0x11878  update display-manager state
0x11bb2  read the descriptor again
0x118d6  re-establish each of four head/output records
```

The descriptor test at `0x1058b` accepts upper word `0x1ccb`, and the loop at
`0x10597` visits heads 0 through 3.  Every hardware-bearing callee is rooted in
the display-manager object at `device + 4 -> +0x1ec`; the routine neither
references the requester helpers nor contains a `0x400..0x524` register
operand.  It always returns false at `0x105b3..0x105bc` [BIN].  This is the
legacy text-mode/display restoration hook, not a successful 3D reset [DER].

### Power transitions re-create board/display services

`HwSetPowerState` at `0x576e7` validates the requested state, serializes it,
and dispatches through `0x577b8`.  Monitor IDs go to `0x57818`, which iterates
the head list and calls output-power method `0x10ffe`.  Global device ID
`0xffffffff` goes to `0x578f4` [BIN].

For states other than 1, `0x578f4` performs the following ordered work after
its client-state checks [BIN]:

```text
0x69eb5; 0x11073; each live head -> 0x10ffe(0);
0x60f47; optional 0x6bfc2/0x6c035; 0x6a0d3(0x10);
0x68206; release callback/event state; 0x10f96
```

For state 1 it updates PCI/config state through `0x18dfe`, invokes the board
service constructor `0x6c058`, calls `0x60f47`, and publishes the new state
through `0x1254b` [BIN].  `0x6c058` reconstructs table-driven board services
through `0x68259`, `0x6bccb`, `0x6a7cc`, `0x6a5b9`, `0x6a442`, `0x686f6`,
`0x6c20d`, `0x6c2e1`, and `0x6a0d3`.

An instruction-level direct-edge closure from `0x578f4` covers 9,319 decoded
instructions and 605 direct calls.  It reaches none of requester quiescence
`0x146ee`, arm `0x224c8`, post `0x224f3`, or completion/kick `0x22533`, and
contains no literal requester-register operand in `0x400..0x524` [BIN].  The
closure has 25 indirect call/jump sites, including configuration accessors and
object callbacks, so this does not prove that a table-driven service never
touches requester state.  It does prove that the saved power path does not
publish a callable requester restart sequence [DER].  Treating a display power
cycle as render recovery would also destroy unrelated output state.

### StartIO and escape surface

`HwStartIO` at `0x58805` serializes a request and calls dispatcher `0x6c755`.
That dispatcher recognizes these request-number ranges [BIN]:

```text
0x230000..0x231ffc  -> 0x7014b
0x232000..0x23207c  -> 0x708de
0x232080..0x2320fc  -> 0x70a8a
0x232100..0x23217c  -> 0x70eab
0x232180..0x2321fc  -> special 0x71618 for 0x2321bc
0x232280..0x2322fc  -> 0x7165f
0x232300..0x23237c  -> 0x5d927
0x232400..0x23247c  -> 0x6adea
0x233000..0x233ffc  -> 0x7190e
```

All other requests are rejected at `0x6c840`.  The direct-edge closure of all
these handlers covers 65,200 decoded instructions and 4,447 direct calls.  It
contains no call to the four requester helpers above [BIN].  There are 202
indirect dispatch sites, so an object method can still submit normal work; the
defensible conclusion is that no escape supplies a statically recoverable
reset contract, not that StartIO can never reach requester work [DER].

The complete PE direct-call references to the four low-level requester helpers
are pinned by `tools/m9-recovery-surface-evidence.py`.  All sites are in the
`0x14540..0x23e2b` requester/context service family; none is in ResetHw, power,
StartIO, or their direct dispatcher functions [BIN].

## Linux close, removal, and disable paths

The open wrapper has no power-management lifecycle to inspect: its
`pci_driver` contains only `.probe` and `.remove`, and `m9x_core_driver_t`
exports only init/cleanup, enable/disable, connect/disconnect, open/close,
interrupt, and ioctl entries [SRC].  There is no suspend, resume, reset,
timeout, watchdog, or recovery callback.

The exported core table in `.rela.data` confirms the same 13 operations [BIN].
In particular, `disable` wrapper `m9x302` calls `m9x449` at `0x3f30`, whose
entire body is only `push rbp; mov rbp,rsp; leave; ret` [BIN].  Hot removal with
open files only stops interrupts, invalidates the device handle, and wakes
clients.  With no open file it calls this empty core disable wrapper [SRC/BIN].

Ordinary close is teardown rather than recovery [SRC/BIN]:

```text
m9x_release -> m9x_disconnect -> m9x_ctx_cleanup -> core close m9x965
  -> m9x717 -> m9x1210 -> m9x106 -> m9x211
```

The requester's destruction stage is `m9x504` at `0x2b770`.  If active, it
sets object `+0xd8 = 1`, clears `+0xd4`, and calls `m9x1016(+0xb0, 1)`.  It does
not test a result; `m9x1016` returns no success value and its stable
`0x508/0x500/0x50c` polling path has no count or time deadline.  The destructor
then invokes the two child teardown methods and clears requester objects
`+0xc0/+0xc8/+0xd0` [BIN].  It never restores the descriptor, posts `0x404`, or
submits a validating fence.  This is an unbounded quiesce-before-free contract,
not hang recovery [DER].

## Strongest static conclusion and bounded recovery

No saved production entry point provides a 3D/global reset contract [DER].
The Windows callback explicitly named ResetHw is display-only and reports
failure; Windows power resume reconstructs board/display services without a
direct requester restart; its complete StartIO direct graph exposes no reset
join.  Linux has no PM/reset callback, its core disable operation is empty, and
close performs an unbounded requester drain followed by destruction.  These
facts add lifecycle and escape coverage to the earlier exhaustive immediate
MMIO-write audit.  They do not prove that the silicon lacks an undocumented
reset bit or that no indirect/table-driven path ever touches a requester word.

A new DRM driver's safest bounded contract is therefore:

1. Stop admission, serialize recovery, mark the current job/fence generation
   failed, and snapshot requester, front-end, interrupt, and fence state before
   acknowledgement or reprogramming.
2. Attempt the proven stable requester quiescence test under an absolute
   deadline.  Abort immediately on removal (`0x8f0 == 0xffffffff`).
3. Only after quiescence, make one requester-local park/restore attempt using
   the recovered `m9x714` descriptor order, restore address windows, kick
   `0x314`, and require a newly seeded no-op fence to advance.
4. If either quiescence or the validation fence fails, keep rendering wedged
   and preserve scanout.  Do not call ResetHw, cycle display power, treat
   `0x31c` as reset, or invent a PCI-function reset.
5. Do not free memory still reachable by a non-quiescent requester.  Terminal
   teardown must first prevent further host DMA (including clearing PCI bus
   mastering when the function remains present), then quarantine outstanding
   objects; the device must not resume without a proven reinitialization path.

The smallest experiment which could strengthen this result is a single
bounded no-op-fence hang injection with pre/post snapshots of `0x8f0`,
`0x31c`, `0x400/0x404/0x448`, `0x500..0x524`, all IRQ status/masks, and fence
memory.  Run exactly one known requester-local restore and record whether a new
fence advances while scanout remains stable.  Failure establishes the point at
which the driver must stay failed closed; success validates requester recovery
only, not a global 3D reset.
