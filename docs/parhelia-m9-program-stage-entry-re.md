# M9 programmable-stage transport and hardware entry association

This note records the static join that is currently possible between linked
GLSL stages in `MxMGLX.dll`, the corresponding Linux `m9x_drv.so` path, and
MxMD's native-program bind.  Addresses are virtual addresses.  `[BIN]` means a
direct instruction/data observation and `[DER]` a conclusion from those
observations.

The binaries used here are:

* Windows `MxMGLX.dll`, SHA-256
  `d4e04dc371809f079651e9938b285878afd42acabcba2eaabef2e65d218e9f86`;
* Windows `MxMD.dll`, SHA-256
  `b6905b6e658b87544bc0081d080190e4f8112b723c0b2fefd781ba5766874f43`;
* Linux 1.4.3 build 98 `m9x_drv.so`, SHA-256
  `3878475450ffad5cd648cc037cc65c29fcb07b5e86caf41ccf5983ef8e570273`.

## Linked GL objects keep explicit stage identity

The Windows link path at `0x10555ff1..0x10556356` records vertex and fragment
presence at program bytes `+0x61ac/+0x61ad`.  It chooses the attached vertex
object into `+0x5ba4` and fragment object into `+0x5ba8`.  Serialization places
the vertex blob pointer and byte length at `+0x5bac/+0x5bb4`, and the fragment
blob pointer and byte length at `+0x5bb0/+0x5bb8` [BIN].  These are distinct
compiler products, not entry offsets into the final native image.

Function `0x1055d920` transports either blob in internal opcode `0x59`, whose
allocated size is `0x20` bytes.  Its 0x1c-byte body is [BIN]:

| Body offset | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `+0x00` | converted linked-program handle, 8 bytes |
| `+0x08` | stage flag: 1 for `GL_VERTEX_SHADER` (`0x8b31`), 0 for fragment |
| `+0x0c` | zero |
| `+0x10` | converted stage-blob pointer/handle, 8 bytes |
| `+0x18` | stage-blob byte length |
| `+0x1c` | output field, initialized to zero; its address is returned |

The vertex branch reads `+0x5bac/+0x5bb4` and marks destination byte `+0x12c`;
the fragment branch reads `+0x5bb0/+0x5bb8` and marks `+0x12d`.  Calls at
`0x10556306` and `0x10556326` supply targets `0x8b31` and `0x8b30`,
respectively [BIN].

When both stages exist, the call at `0x10556352` passes the **fragment** opcode
`0x59` output, the 14-dword varying remap at program `+0x5bbc`, and its
high-water value at `+0x5bf4` to `0x1055deb0`.  That function emits opcode
`0x67`, size `0x18`, and marks destination byte `+0x12e` [BIN].  Thus `0x67`
is the cross-stage link record and its stage-object operand is specifically the
fragment install result [DER].  This fact does not identify an MxMD hardware
entry register.

The independently compiled Linux path confirms the association.  Link routine
`m9x4183` at `0x6be950` uses presence bytes `+0x6118/+0x6119`, vertex and
fragment blobs `+0x5ae8/+0x5af0`, lengths `+0x5af8/+0x5afc`, varying remap
`+0x5b00`, and high-water `+0x5b38` [BIN].  Function `m9x23579` at `0x6af060`
emits opcode `0x59`, size `0x20`; target `0x8b31` selects the vertex blob and
passes stage flag 1 to `0x5b6690`, while the other branch selects the fragment
blob and passes zero.  At `0x6bee2b..0x6bee44`, the value in `[rsp+8]` from the
fragment install is passed to `m9x13837` at `0x6aee50` along with the remap and
high-water.  That function emits opcode `0x67`, size `0x18` [BIN].

## Linux closes the private-call stage join

The Linux build contains the private wrapper and the backend in one image, so
the call following the `0x59` marker can be followed farther than its Windows
counterpart.  Wrapper `0x5b6690` tests the serialized stage flag directly.
Flag zero calls `0x3b8a50`; that path uses state object `device+0x2560` and
calls compiler/install routine `0x4360c0`.  Flag one calls `0x3b8d60`; that
path uses `device+0x2550` and calls `0x435b30` [BIN].  Joined to the
`GL_VERTEX_SHADER` test in `0x6af060`, this assigns the objects without relying
on names [DER]:

| stage flag | GL stage | backend state object | compiler/install routine | current handle |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | fragment | `device+0x2560` | `0x4360c0` | object `+0x10e` |
| 1 | vertex | `device+0x2550` | `0x435b30` | object `+0x1f1` |

Both compiler/install wrappers receive the source blob pointer and byte length
from `0x59`, and both retain the supplied source byte length at compiled object
`+0x40`.  That field is source transport metadata; it is not emitted beside a
hardware entry control [BIN].

The `0x67` route is fragment-owned too.  Its body wrapper `0x5b6550` calls
`0x3b8c90`.  The latter loads `device+0x2560`, compares the `0x67` fragment
handle with current association `+0x11c`, and calls `0x431d70` with that handle,
the varying remap, and the high-water count (rejected above 15) [BIN].  Thus
`0x67` creates/updates cross-stage association data in the fragment backend;
it is not a second stage program upload [DER].

This route is not peculiar to one X-server build.  The unique target-`0x8b31`,
stage-dispatch, and `0x67` association signatures occur once in every one of
the 16 saved `m9x_drv.so` images and every saved 64-bit `libGL.so.2.0.0` image,
from X server 6.9 through 1.15.  In every copy, rel32 decoding reaches the same
`+0x2560` fragment and `+0x2550` vertex object split and the same fragment
`+0x11c` association field [BIN].

The Windows opcode numbers are software-record identifiers, not native shader
opcodes.  Allocator `MxMGLX!0x100030c0` groups records under an eight-byte
`{opcode,count}` header.  Flush `0x100031a0` passes the byte span to
`0x1002ea20`, resets the buffer, and writes `{0xffff,1}` at its new head
[BIN].  That `0xffff` terminates the private software record stream.  It never
appears in the native 8-byte shader image and therefore supplies no hardware
program stop rule [DER].

The exact producer signatures `push 0; push 0x20; push 0x59` and
`push 0; push 0x18; push 0x67` each occur once in `MxMGLX.dll` and do not occur
in `MxMD.dll` or `MxMDI.dll` [BIN].  This rules out a copied direct-call helper
as the missing Windows join.  It does not rule out an indirect escape/table
dispatcher, so it is negative evidence rather than a recovered consumer.

## What the two recovered hardware starts prove

MxMD function `0x13bf80` builds one concatenated, 8-byte-instruction image for
the fixed fragment-chain path.  It records the two chain starts as cumulative
byte offsets shifted right by three at state `+0xba8/+0xbac`, the aligned image
length at `+0xbb0`, and its pointer at `+0xbb4` [BIN].

Emitter `0xf74d0` has two program-bind forms [BIN]:

* External/resource form: index `69` is relocation-backed from state
  `+0xa0/+0xa4`; dirty bit `0x80` emits `6a <- +0xa8`, and dirty bit `0x100`
  emits `6d <- +0xbc`.
* Inline fixed-chain form: indices `68` and `60..67` upload `+0xbb4` in
  32-byte lines.  With `+0xba4 == 0`, it emits `69 <- 4` and packs
  `low16(+0xba8)` and `low16(+0xbac)` into the low and high halves of `6a`.
  With `+0xba4 != 0`, it emits the second start to `6d`, then `69 <- 4` and the
  first start to `6a`.

This proves two entry slots into a shared native image and shows that `+0xa8`
and `+0xbc` are the corresponding external-form controls [DER].  It does **not**
prove that `6a` is the vertex entry or that `6d` is the fragment entry.  The
inline image is selected by the fixed vertex/declaration-conversion builder;
its second slot can be a companion chain selected by `0x13b570`.  Packing both
starts into `6a` when the companion mode is inactive is also incompatible with
assigning a universal shader-stage name from the register number alone.

Linux independently contains the same emitter as `m9x11728` at `0x4b9340`,
with state layout shifted by `0x28`: native image pointer/length are
`+0xbe0/+0xbd8`, starts are `+0xbd0/+0xbd4`, and companion flag is `+0xbcc`.
It emits the same `68`, `60..67`, `69`, `6a`, and optional `6d` selectors
[BIN].  Its producer `m9x24483` at `0x44ba40` builds those starts from selected
fixed-chain fragments and cumulative byte sizes.  Neither function reads the
typed current handles at vertex object `+0x1f1` or fragment object `+0x10e`.
This cross-check therefore preserves, rather than closes, the final stage to
entry-register boundary [DER].

## Final Linux state ownership and dispatch

The object passed to `m9x11728` is no longer structurally anonymous.  Generic
program-substate initializer `m9x17453` at `0x4b8b80` initializes
external-resource identity fields `+0xa0/+0xa8`, primary entry control
`+0xb0`, companion entry control `+0xd0`, and the inline-program fields later
used by the emitter [BIN].  In temporary top-state construction at
`0x4b4478`, that initialized object is installed specifically at top-state
`+0xc8`; the other substates go to `+0xb8`, `+0xc0`, `+0xd0`, and `+0xd8`
[BIN].

The live hardware-state constructor gives the specialized form of the same
ownership.  `m9x3673` constructs `m9x18369` at live state `+0xbb0` and
`m9x31420` at live state `+0x17c0`.  Its owner pointers are stored at `+0xd0`
and `+0xe0`; the corresponding dispatch view is biased by eight bytes and sees
them as top-state `+0xc8` and `+0xd8` [BIN][DER].  Independent reset routine
`m9x11566` removes the need to infer that bias: it loads top-state `+0xc8` and
calls `m9x18369`, then loads top-state `+0xd8` and tail-calls `m9x31420`
[BIN].  `m9x18369` initializes a large specialized program state including
the emitter's `+0xa0/+0xa8/+0xb0/+0xd0` and inline image
`+0xbcc..+0xbe0`.  `m9x31420` initializes a separate `0xd0`-byte resource/link
state with three descriptor/pointer pairs at `+0x98/+0xa0`, `+0xa8/+0xb0`,
and `+0xb8/+0xc0` [BIN].

The complete final dispatch chain is [BIN]:

```text
m9x15197 (0x4b6c40)
  promote desired top_state+0xc8 dirty state
  switch context current top state at context+0x5f8
  -> m9x25088 (0x889a60)
       top_state+0xc8 -> m9x26001 (0x4ba3a0)
         -> m9x11728 (0x4b9340)
              resource 69, entry controls 6a/6d, or inline image
```

`m9x26001` has one direct owner, the `top_state+0xc8` call in `m9x25088`,
and `m9x11728` has one direct owner, the call at `m9x26001+0x579`.  Before a
state switch, `m9x15197` merges the program substate's current dirty word into
its pending word.  When byte `+1` has its high bit set it also promotes each
28-byte sparse record from `+0xe8` to its pending word at `+0xec`, through
offset `+0x7e8` [BIN].  This proves the lifetime and dirty-state route into the
emitter, but it does not identify the earlier writer that associates a
compiled native descriptor with `+0xa0/+0xa8/+0xb0/+0xd0` [DER].

## Compiler/cache vtables and the excluded resource-copy join

The compiler/cache path is live through indirect calls that a rel32-only
census misses.  Parent constructor `m9x1757` installs the vtable whose address
point is `0x121e990`.  Its slot `+0x08` is `m9x15760`, a getter returning
parent `+0x60`.  Factory `m9x8953` constructs an `m9x28041` child and stores it
at that field.  At `0x5b15d1..0x5b15dd`, the GL context calls the getter and
stores the returned child at context `+0x9ba8` [BIN].

The `m9x28041` child vtable address point is `0x121e7b0` [BIN]:

| slot | function | established role |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| `+0x00` | `m9x7986` | child destructor |
| `+0x08` | `m9x28572` | child callback |
| `+0x10` | `m9x3336` | child callback |
| `+0x18` | `m9x22637` | live update/compile entry |
| `+0x20` | `m9x1950` | live update/compile entry |
| `+0x28` | `m9x27762` | child callback |
| `+0x30` | `m9x30491` | child callback |
| `+0x38` | `m9x24167` | child callback |
| `+0x40` | `m9x10959` | returns child `+0x118` |

GL paths at `0x5a56d6` and `0x5a544e/0x5a55f8` load context `+0x9ba8` and
call vtable slots `+0x18` and `+0x20`, respectively.  The two exported entries
have no direct rel32 callers, but both call `m9x24062`; the vtable and context
ownership therefore prove they are live [BIN][DER].

This indirect path also disproves the most attractive proposed final join.
Device setup `m9x11513` maps child `+0x38` to device `+0x2588` and child
`+0x40` to device `+0x2590`.  At `0x4530c7..0x4530db`, `m9x24062` passes
child `+0x38` as `rdx`, child `+0x40` as `rcx`, and calls `m9x21983` with no
pointer adjustment [BIN].  `m9x21983` copies two compiled-native records from
`[compiled_pipeline+0x138]+0x2f1/+0x2f9` and `+0x301/+0x309` into destination
`+0x98/+0xa0` and `+0xb8/+0xc0` [BIN].

That destination is exactly the separate resource/link object.  During device
construction `m9x4335` requests `0xd0` bytes, initializes through `+0xc8`,
stores the allocation at device `+0x2590`, and wires it beside device
`+0x2588` through `m9x21443` [BIN].  The identical `m9x31420` initializer is
used for live state `+0x17c0` and top-state `+0xd8`.  Final dispatcher
`m9x25088` sends `+0xd8` to `m9x21922`, then independently sends `+0xc8`
through `m9x26001` to `m9x11728` [BIN].  The matching field numbers in these
two types do not establish aliasing.  The compiler-native copy is now assigned
to the resource/link path and excluded as the producer of the final program
bind [DER].  Constructor-relocation vtable recovery, the shared child callback,
the device-pointer setup, both compiled-resource copies, the `0xd0` allocation,
and the distinct `+0xd8/+0xc8` dispatches reproduce in all 16 saved
`m9x_drv.so` images and all 16 saved combined `libGL.so.2.0.0` images [BIN].

Windows gives a consistent private-boundary result.  The decoded import table
of the saved `MxMGLX.dll` names `DDRAW.dll` and ordinary system DLLs, but does
not import `MxMD.dll` or `MxMDI.dll` [BIN].  Together with the unique software
record producers already described, this rules out a statically named
cross-DSO compiler-to-MxMD call.  It leaves an escape, callback table, copied
object, or command-record consumer as the Windows ownership boundary [DER].

Two tempting alternate stage wrappers are excluded from the in-image live GL
route.  Fragment `m9x1996` at `0x3b8ae0` and vertex `m9x13428` at `0x3b8df0`
select builder mode 2 and optionally supply the persistent constant banks at
fragment state `+0xba` and vertex state `+0x91`.  Across all 16 saved 64-bit
`m9x_drv.so` images and all 16 combined `libGL.so.2.0.0` images, neither
wrapper has a direct call/jump, RIP-relative address materialization, or ELF
relocation owner [BIN].  They remain exported ABI entries, so an external
caller is possible, but the saved combined images provide no evidence that
the ordinary private GL stream calls them [DER].  The ordinary calls instead
reach the mode-1 wrappers at `0x3b8a50/0x3b8d60`.  Mode-2/BM state therefore
cannot supply the missing live programmable-stage join without runtime
evidence.

The often-cited state builder at `0x1397e0` does not close this gap.  Its call
to `0x1743d0` writes float/color state at record offsets `+0x70..+0xec`, and
`0x13ee10` consumes the record during draw/vertex state construction [BIN].
Static evidence does not make that 256-byte cache a fragment compiler result.

## Exact remaining boundary

The saved binaries establish this chain:

```text
GL linked program
  -> distinct vertex/fragment serialized blobs
  -> opcode 0x59(stage flag, blob, length)
  -> opcode 0x67(fragment-install result, varying map, high-water)
  -> typed vertex (+0x2550) / fragment (+0x2560) backend objects [Linux]
  -> compiler/cache child at context +0x9ba8
  -> compiled native pairs in separate top_state+0xd8 resource/link state
  -> [unrecovered writer of final top_state+0xc8 program state]
  -> native image resource or inline image
  -> entry controls 6a / 6d
```

Static code now joins `0x59/0x67` to typed backend objects and follows the live
compiler/cache vtable into its resource/link copy.  That copy is not the final
program state.  No static call, vtable, relocation, constructor, or recovered
object-copy edge joins either compiled stage/current handle to the program
substate external fields in MxMD state
`+0xa8/+0xbc` or `+0xba8/+0xbac` (Linux `+0xb0/+0xd0` or
`+0xbd0/+0xbd4`).  The native bind producer found in both operating systems is
the separate fixed-chain builder.  Therefore the final programmable
vertex/fragment-to-entry association remains a capture boundary.  A Mesa
driver can implement typed stage blobs, the known transport layout, and the
resource/link state, but cannot safely populate the final external descriptor
or select the final two hardware entries from this evidence alone.

The smallest decisive differential capture uses one fixed vertex shader and
two fragment shaders differing only in a constant output.  Disable the saved
driver's bus-master microcode options (`PsBmMicrocode=0`, `CeBmMicrocode=0`)
when possible, record the fragment `0x59` and following `0x67`, then capture the
native bytes and final `69/6a/6d` writes immediately before the first draw.  If
only image bytes change, repeat with a fixed fragment shader and two vertex
shaders.  If the external form remains active, dump the resource referenced by
the `69` relocation as well as `+0xa8/+0xbc`; an MMIO trace alone may contain
the entry values but omit the program image.  These two comparisons are enough
to associate stages without relying on names inferred from `Ps` or `Ce`.

Run `python3 tools/m9-program-stage-entry-evidence.py` to recheck the binary
hashes and the critical stage/opcode/entry joins above.  Run
`python3 tools/m9-entry-resource-boundary-evidence.py` to recheck the 32-image
alternate-wrapper ownership census, program-substate construction, dirty
promotion, compiler/cache vtables, object allocation/copy ownership, Windows
import boundary, and sole final dispatch chain.

## September 2026 live closure

The requested differential is now captured in
`captures/m9x-linux-glsl-ab-20260914` and analyzed in
`parhelia-m9-glsl-bind-capture.md`.  Both the vertex-only and fragment-only
A/B/A switches keep `69=0x11e42000`, `6a=0x25010000`, and `6b=0x1030`, while
`6c` selects `0x40c3a301`, `0x40c3a881`, then the original
`0x40c3a301`.  Allocation capture joins the high address to a 0x21000-byte
system resource at `0x40c3a000`; masking the retained low tag selects record
offsets `0x300` and `0x880`.  This closes the final live ownership edge as an
atomic linked-pair state record.  It does not expose the native bytes or the
two internal stage entries within that record; those remain resource-format
and compiler-coverage work rather than final-dispatch ownership work.
