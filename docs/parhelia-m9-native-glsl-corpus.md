# M9148 native GLSL programs from the vendor ICD

This note is the vendor-side ground truth for a NIR-to-native backend in the
clean-room m9x Mesa driver.  The captures cover 112 GLSL 1.10 and
fixed-function cases in `captures/m9x-vendor-glsl-programs-20260915`.  For each
case they give the complete bound `c2` program image, the draw passes with
their `c3` entries, the constant spans with values joined to uniforms and
literals, and a full readback checked against a reference evaluation.

Labels:
* **CAPTURED**: read from those vendor captures.
* **MEASURED**: vendor readback.
* **STATIC**: from earlier binary notes.
* **DERIVED**: a conclusion that follows from several captured facts; the
  reasoning is given.

Field names follow `tools/m9-native-disasm.py`.  Each slot is `W0 W1`:

```text
W0: a[2:0]=31:29  b=28:22  c=21:15  d=14:8  cls=7:5  op0=4:0
W1: hi=31:28  op2=25:21  e=20:14  a[6:3]=3:0  lo=7:4
```

`--` in a listing means the field value is 0x7f (unused operand).
`tools/m9-glsl-program-extract.py CASE` prints any case listed below.

## 1. Image layout, entries and passes

* **Image layout (CAPTURED).** One `c2` image holds the fragment program(s)
  first, then the vertex program(s).  Raster draws bind `c3` = fragment
  entry; preprocessing draws bind `c3` = vertex entry.  A plain GLSL pair
  uses three preprocessing draws: the application vertex program, then two
  fixed stages of 7 and 25 slots.  With a 4-slot fragment program the
  entries are `4, 0x13, 0x1a` (`fs-mul`).  Fixed-function drawing uses one
  to three preprocessing entries (`cases.md`).
* **Multiple fragment programs (CAPTURED).** Several fragment programs can
  sit in one image, one per raster draw:
  * texture sampling with a computed coordinate uses two raster draws
    (section 6), with entries `0` and `4`/`7`;
  * 14 varyings split the fragment work into three raster draws, with entries
    `0, 9, 0x22` (`vs-varyings-max`).  No pass interpolates more than 6
    varying slots.
* **Stop slot (CAPTURED).** The only stop word present is
  `ffff801c a01fc00f`.  The compiler endpoint `fffc7e1d a2803f0f` occurs 0
  times in 112 images.
  * Vertex programs end with the stop slot.
  * Fragment programs shorter than 4 slots are padded with it
    (`fs-color`: 2 slots + 2 stops).
  * 53 of 83 `fs-*` fragment programs have no stop slot before the next
    entry (`fs-mul`: 4 operation slots, then the vertex program at slot 4).
    The captures do not show what bounds such a program in the raster pass
    (section 13).
* **c2 addresses (CAPTURED).** Every case bound one `c2` address for both
  frames.  The "two alternating C2 allocations" seen with glxgears did not
  occur for these single-program clients.

## 2. Selector classes

### Fragment stage (CAPTURED census of 121 fragment programs)

| selector | role | evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `op2=0x10`, `a=0x40+8k` / `0x42+8k`, `c=0x44+8k` / `0x45+8k`, `b=0x79` | varying slot `k` (0..5), xy / zw; `W1[3:0] = 8+k` | `pr-two-texcoords` k=0,1; `vs-varyings-4` k=0..3; `vs-varyings-max` k=0..5 |
| `0x00/0x02` (first texture), `0x04/0x06` (second) as sources | sampled texel xy / zw | `fs-tex2d`, `fs-tex2d-two` |
| `0x7a` | `gl_FragCoord` source | `fs-fragcoord`, `pr-fragcoord-300` |
| `0x7b` (field `b`) | facing source, used with a constant (-0.5, 0.5) | `fs-frontfacing` |
| `d=0x2d` | colour output: `op0=1d` writes R,G; `op0=1e` writes B,A | all cases |
| `d=0x21` | `gl_FragDepth` output | `fs-fragdepth`, `fs-fragdepth-const` |
| `d=0x40` with `op2=0x1e` | KIL (discard) | discard and alpha-test cases |
| `d=0x00..0x0f, 0x11, 0x13..0x1f` | temporaries (destinations seen: 0x00–0x0f, 0x11, 0x13–0x1f) | census |
| `e` | constant entry index in constant-reading forms | section 3 |

Varying slots are assigned in the order the fragment program uses them,
whatever the varying is.  `fs-color` (`gl_Color`), `fs-varying` (custom) and
`fs-texcoord` (`gl_TexCoord[0]`) have byte-identical `c2` images, fragment
and vertex programs included.  Their command streams differ only in
`ab/ac` and the `1b` fence word (CAPTURED).  How a varying is routed to a
slot is therefore not in `c2` (section 13).

**Registers (CAPTURED example, DERIVED model).**

`fs-const` builds `vec4(0.375, 0.625, 0.875, 0.9375)`:

```text
0 ffff801e a280330f  d=00 op0=1e <- e0 (0.625)
1 ffff931d a280f30f  d=13 op0=1d <- e3 (0.875)
2 ffff911d a280b30f  d=11 op0=1d <- e2 (0.375)
3 ffc9811d a28fff0f  d=01 op0=1d <- 13
4 ffff811e e280730f  d=01 op0=1e <- e1 (0.9375)
5 ffc8801d a28fff0f  d=00 op0=1d <- 11
6 ffc0ad1e a29fff1f  B,A <- 01
7 ffc02d1d a29fff1f  R,G <- 00
```

It reads back `96,159,223,239` (MEASURED).  Temporary 00 must therefore hold
(0.375, 0.625) and 01 hold (0.875, 0.9375).

DERIVED from that: each register index holds two scalars.  For temporaries,
`op0=1d` writes the first scalar, `1e` the second, and `1c` both (`fs-mad`:
`5e62811c` interpolates z,w into 01).  A vec4 occupies an xy register and a
zw register.  `W1[4]` (`lo` bit 0) is 1 in every two-scalar write seen and 0
in single-scalar constant MOVs.

The vendor writes temporaries 0x00 and 0x01 with these forms.  The lockup
recorded in `parhelia-m9-native-fragment-program-re.md` used
`ffff801c a280331f` / `ffff811c a280731f`: `op0=1c` with `W1[4]=1` on a
constant source, a combination absent from the corpus.  The program also
sat at slot 40 after the vertex program.

### Vertex stage (CAPTURED)

| selector | role | evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `0x4e/0x4f` | `gl_Vertex` xy / zw | `vs-vertex-direct`, `vs-uniform-mat` (matrix rows applied to b=4e/4f) |
| `0x46/0x47` | `gl_Color` or a linked user attribute | `vs-attrib` (`a` bound to location 6) has the same `c2` as `vs-vertex-direct` |
| `d=0x11/0x13` | varying slot 0 output xy / zw | `vs-uniform-color`: `ffff919c a280331f` (11 <- e0 = u.xy), `ffff939c a280731f` (13 <- e1 = u.zw) |
| `d=0x15/0x17`, `0x19/0x1b` | further output pairs | `vs-varyings-2`, `vs-varyings-max`; the slot for each pair is not proven |
| `d=0x21` | position result of the fixed tail | every vertex program |
| `0x56/0x57` | read only in `vs-lighting`, whose remaining inputs are `gl_Normal` and `L`; `gl_Normal` is not proven | `vs-lighting` |

## 3. Constant layout (CAPTURED)

* **Entries.** Entries are two float32s (8 bytes) in `[8d & ~7, 8e & ~7)`.
  Their count is `8c[14:8]`.  The low bit of `8d/8e` is a tag.
* **Placement.** The fragment span starts at the arena base (`40c3a000`) and
  the preprocessing span follows directly.
* **Literals.** A literal scalar takes one entry `(v, v)`, e.g. `fs-floor`
  (0.25, 0.25), (4, 4).
* **Uniform vectors.** A vec4 takes two entries `(x, y)`, `(z, w)`; a float
  uniform takes `(f, 0)` (`fs-loop-break`).
* **Matrices.** A matrix column takes the same xy/zw pair form.  `fs-mat4`
  stores column 3 first (`e0 = m[12], m[13]`, `e1 = m[14], m[15]`), then
  columns 2, 1, 0.
* **Entry order** follows first use in the compiled code, not declaration
  order:
  * `fs-swizzle` (`u.wzyx`) stores `(u.z, u.w)` before `(u.x, u.y)`;
  * `fs-vec-mat4` interleaves columns.
* **Fixed fragment tail.** Every fragment span ends with `(0, 1), (1, 0.5)`.
  The compare forms of if/else, discard and alpha test add `(2.00000024, 1)`
  (`fs-ternary` and `fs-step` do not); loops add counter literals such as
  `(3, 3)`, `(1, 1)`, `(0, 0)` and set `8c[24]` (`01500a00`).
* **Preprocessing span.** The application vertex constants come first, then
  13 fixed entries for the 128x128 viewport:

```text
(64,-64) (0.5,1) (64,64) (0.5,128) (0,2) (-16352,16351) (0,0) (1,0.5)
(inf,-inf) (1,238.984375) (1,-238.984375) (127,128) (1.25,1.5)
```

  64 is half the viewport size.  The role of the other fixed entries is not
  decoded.  A backend can copy them per viewport as a template, but must
  check them against a second window size first (section 13).

DERIVED: the entry order is the compiler's choice.  A backend may use any
order that its `e` operands match; the vendor order is not a hardware
requirement.

## 4. Arithmetic templates (CAPTURED, readback MEASURED)

All sequences are the complete fragment program of the named case.  The
varying setup is always the two interpolation slots
`5e62801c ee0ffc18` (zw -> 00) and `1e621a1c ae0ffc18` (xy -> 1a), with other
destinations as listed.

```text
fs-uniform   ffffad1e e280731f  B,A <- e1         (u.zw)
             ffffad1d a280331f  R,G <- e0         (u.xy)
fs-mul       e03fad1e a020414f  op2=01 B,A <- 00 * e1
             e6bfad1d a020014f  op2=01 R,G <- 1a * e0
fs-add       1fc0ad1e bc8fc110  op2=04 B,A <- 00 + e1(c=01)
             5fc02d1d bc8fc113  op2=04 R,G <- 1a + e0(c=00)
fs-sub       ffc02d1e a0804ddf  op2=04 B,A <- e1 - 00   (u - v1)
             ffcd2d1d a0800ddf  op2=04 R,G <- e0 - 1a
fs-min       e0002d5e a3204d5f  op2=19 cls=2 B,A <- min(00, e1)
             e68d2d5d a3200d5f  op2=19 cls=2 R,G <- min(1a, e0)
fs-max       e0002d7e / e68d2d7d  same W1, cls=3
fs-neg       ffc0931c a2afff1f  op2=15 13 <- -01
             ffc0111c e2afff1f  op2=15 11 <- -00
             then ADD 7fc0821c bc8fc112 / 3fc02d1d bc8fc112, output ffc12d1e a29fff1f
fs-swizzle   ffffad1e e280732f  B,A <- e1 (u.w,u.z stored as (z,w), swap W1[5])
             ffffad1d a280332f  R,G <- e0
fs-step      e000ad3e 9001414f  op2=00 cls=1 hi=9  B,A <- step(e1, 00)
             e6802d3d 9001414f  R,G <- step(e0, 1a)
```

`fs-mad` (`v1 * u + w`) and `pr-temp-chain` (`t = c*2; t = t - 0.5`) are 7
slots: two interpolations, two MUL into temps `13/11`, two ADD, and output
`ffc12d1e a29fff1f`.

Longer built-ins are exact, verified sequences in the fixture:

| case | slots |
|---|---:|
| `fs-dot3` | 8 |
| `fs-dot4` | 9 |
| `fs-normalize` | 18 |
| `fs-length` | 18 |
| `fs-distance` | 19 |
| `fs-cross` | 13 |
| `fs-div` | 25 |
| `fs-floor` | 9 |
| `fs-ceil` | 9 |
| `fs-fract` | 7 |
| `fs-mod` | 30 |
| `fs-sign` | 11 |
| `fs-abs` | 7 |
| `fs-clamp` | 7 |
| `fs-mix` | 7 |
| `fs-exp` | 32 |
| `fs-log` | 33 |
| `fs-pow` | 64 |
| `fs-sqrt` | 35 |
| `fs-rsq` | 32 |
| `fs-sin` | 21 |
| `fs-smoothstep` | 41 |
| `fs-mat2` | 7 |
| `fs-mat3` | 11 |
| `fs-mat4` | 11 |
| `fs-vec-mat4` | 13 |

**op2 values (CAPTURED usage, not global mnemonics).**

| op2 | cls | role |
|---|---|---|
| 0x01 | | multiply |
| 0x04 | | add, subtract with the negate bit |
| 0x14 | | move |
| 0x15 | | negated move |

## 5. Outputs

* **Colour (CAPTURED).** Colour is written to `d=0x2d` in both halves.  A
  program either computes into temporaries and ends with
  `ffc{src}2d1d a29fff1f` (R,G) / `ffc{src}ad1e a29fff1f` (B,A), or writes the
  last operation straight into 0x2d (`fs-mul`, `fs-add`).
* **Depth (CAPTURED, MEASURED).** `gl_FragDepth` is written to `d=0x21`.
  `fs-fragdepth-const` writes it with
  `a54aa11d a3204f52` (op2=19) from temp 15 = e0 (0.25).  The depth
  readback is 0.25 at all sample points.  `fs-fragdepth`
  (`gl_FragDepth = gl_TexCoord[0].x`) reads back exactly `(x + 0.5) / 128`.
* **Selector census (CAPTURED).** No program writes 0x58 or 0x78.

## 6. Texture sampling (CAPTURED)

* **Direct sampling.** There is no texture-sample instruction in `c2`.  With a
  varying coordinate, the sampled texel is already present when the fragment
  program starts: in 0x00/0x02 for the first bound texture and 0x04/0x06 for
  the second.

  ```text
  fs-tex2d        ffc02d1d e29fff1f  R,G <- 00
                  ffc12d1e a29fff1f  B,A <- 02
  pr-tex-mul-color  interp 5e62841c ee003c18 (zw->04), 1e621a1c ae003c18 (xy->1a)
                  413fad1e ac200140  B,A <- 02 * 04
                  06bfad1d ac200140  R,G <- 00 * 1a
  fs-tex2d-two    c0bfad1e ec200140  B,A <- 06 * 02
                  803fad1d ac200140  R,G <- 04 * 00
  ```

* **Texture unit.** The unit is not encoded in the program.  `fs-tex2d` (unit
  0, 4x4) and `fs-tex2d-unit1` (unit 1, 2x2) have identical `c2`.  Their
  streams differ only in the bound-texture packet `78/79/7a`
  (`79=c8010004/7a=00010004` vs `c8010002/00010002`), apart from `ab/ac` and
  the fence.  `fs-tex2d-two` adds a second `78/79/7a` packet and changes `88`
  (`0010ffe3` -> `0030ff8f`) and `22` (`2303` -> `2403`).
* **Sampler word.** `7c` is `02409200` for 2-D and cube sampling and
  `12409200` for the 3-D and rectangle cases.  Plain draws bind `7c=00000200`.
* **Computed coordinates.** A computed coordinate (`texture2DProj` with vec3,
  bias, cube, 3-D, rectangle, `shadow2D`, swizzled coordinate) makes the
  vendor emit two raster draws in one submission.
  * Draw 1 (`c3=0`, `7c=00000200`, `88=0110fffc`) runs a program that writes
    the coordinate into 0x11/0x13 and never writes 0x2d:

    ```text
    fs-tex2d-bias  1e62111c ee0ffc18  11 <- interp xy
                   ffc8931c a28fff1f  13 <- 11
                   ffff911e a280330f  11.second <- e0 (bias 1.0)
                   ffff801c a01fc00f
    ```

  * Draw 2 (`c3=4` or `7`, `7c=02409200`) runs the plain texture program
    (`R,G <- 00`, `B,A <- 02`).
  * `fs-texcube` computes `(1, t*2-1, s*2-1)` in its 7-slot first program.
  * `fs-shadow2d`'s second program writes both output halves from 00 with
    `ffc02d1e e6803b2f` / `ffc02d1d a29fff3f`.  Its W1 differs from the plain
    texture program (`e29fff1f` / `a29fff1f`); the field is not decoded.
* **Readback (MEASURED).** Readbacks match the reference for 2-D, unit 1,
  proj3/proj4, bias, modulate, two samplers, swizzle, cube, 3-D, rectangle
  and shadow.

## 7. Discard, compare, select, loops (CAPTURED)

```text
fs-discard-all      ...  bfffc0bc afdfc302  KIL (cls=5 op2=1e d=40) on temp 15
fs-discard-cond     15 slots: compare 3 slots (ffc182bc 9000d03f, e541131d 9001400f,
                    7fc111bc 8800cc12), select e4c091bc 5360000f,
                    ADD 3fc8801e ec8fcc32, KIL 1fffc0bc afdfc300, outputs
pr-discard-color    14 slots, same structure on gl_Color.r (e041137d 9001400f cls=3)

fs-if-uniform       16 slots: compare, then conditional MOVs with W1 hi=4
                    (ffff811c 4280731f, ffff801c 4280331f) and outputs
fs-ternary          compare e041117d 900140cf (cls=3), select
                    e44002bc a3604d1f / e44d2dbe a3600d1f (op2=1b) into 02 and 0x2d
fs-loop-fixed/-uniform  44 slots with the same layout for a literal and a uniform bound:
                    control words 01000000 01501000, ffffffff 03900800,
                    fffffffe 00403e00, 00000005 05cf8000, ..., ffffffee 04c00085,
                    three zero slots, then outputs and four stop slots
fs-loop-break       50 slots, adds 3ffffff8 00400800 and e1bf861f a2d1305f
```

* **Loop form.** Loops are not unrolled.  They contain control slots whose
  `W0` is not the operand form (e.g. `ffffffff`, `00000005`).  These carry
  counters and relative targets.  The static control-flow note
  (`parhelia-m9-native-control-flow-re.md`) has BREAK/ELSE templates of the
  same family.
* **Conditional marks.** `W1` hi values 4 and 5 appear only in conditional
  programs (census over all 112 images):
  * hi=4 in `fs-if-uniform`, `fs-if-varying`, `vs-if` and `vs-loop`;
  * hi=5 in `fs-discard-*`, `pr-discard-color`, `fs-loop-*` and `vs-loop`.

  Plain programs have exactly one slot with `W1` bit 30 set: 112 of 121
  fragment and 308 of 310 vertex programs.  The discard, if and loop programs
  mark 2–4 slots.  The meaning of both fields is not decoded.

## 8. Fragment built-ins and derivatives (CAPTURED)

```text
fs-fragcoord   fffd001c a28fccdf  00 <- 7a (gl_FragCoord)
               fec2931d b041015f  op2=02 with b=7b
fs-frontfacing fec2111d f041003f  op2=02 11 <- 7b, e4 (-0.5, 0.5)
               e44181bc b360811f, e440adbe b360011f  select u : w
fs-dfdx        1e62001d ae0ffc08, ffff9100 a00fc00f x2, 1fff821d 8c020c00 (DDX), ...
fs-dfdy        ..., 1fff831d 8c024f30 (DDY: W1 bit 14 set)
```

The DDX/DDY result slots have the family of the STATIC lowerer templates
(`dfff801c 8c020d10` / `8c024d10`), with W1 bit 14 as the axis bit.

## 9. Vertex stage (CAPTURED)

* **Fixed tail.** Application vertex programs end with a fixed tail:
  viewport, guard band and position into 0x21.  `vs-vertex-direct` slots
  22..31 are `ffffa11c a281f30f` ... `bfffa11c ac81c1c3`, and the same words
  close `vs-attrib`, `vs-uniform-color` and `vs-uniform-mat`, only
  re-indexed to their constant entries.
* **Split passes.** Many varyings split the vertex work into several
  preprocessing draws: 4 for `vs-varyings-4`, 9 for `vs-varyings-max`.
* **Varying limits.** 14 vec4 varyings link (`GL_MAX_VARYING_FLOATS = 60`).
* **Vertex texture fetch.** `vs-texlod` uses a separate preprocessing draw
  (`c3=8`, `7c=00009200`).  Its readback is black (MEASURED, same as the
  2026-09-14 special capture).

## 10. Fixed-function join (CAPTURED)

* **cls bit.** Fixed-function programs use the GLSL slot forms with `W0` bit 7
  set (cls 4), e.g. `ff-color` `5e62ad9e ee003c18 / 1e622d9d ae003c18`.  The
  GLSL `fs-color` has `5e62ad1e / 1e622d1d`.  The readbacks are identical.
* **Texture environments.** `ff-tex-modulate` equals `pr-tex-mul-color` with
  cls 4; `ff-tex-replace` is the MOV from 00/02.  `ff-tex-decal` (8 slots),
  `ff-tex-blend` (8, env colour in e0/e1) and `ff-tex-add` (6) are exact
  sequences in the fixture.
* **Fog.** Fog interpolates varying slot 3
  (`5e6e8c9c ae1ffc1b`, a=0x5a c=0x5d).  Linear, EXP and EXP2 fog produce
  the same 7-slot fragment program, raster `88=0910df10` and 13 raster
  constants.  The fog mode differs only in the preprocessing program and its
  `88` (`0700fff8` linear, `0700ffe0` EXP/EXP2).
* **Alpha test.** Alpha test appends the compare and KIL sequence of section 7.

## 11. Measured anomalies (MEASURED)

| case | reference | readback |
|---|---|---|
| `fs-dfdy` `vec4(0.25, dFdy(t)*64, 0.5, 1)` | G = 128 | G = 0 |
| `fs-fwidth` | 128, 128 | 128, 127 (matches) |
| `fs-fragcoord` B = `gl_FragCoord.z` (z=0 geometry, depth test on) | 128 | 0 |
| `vs-texlod` vertex `texture2DLod` | texel colours | 0,0,0,255 |

A negative `dFdy` clamped to 0 is consistent with the `fs-fwidth` match, but
the sign is not measured.  In `fs-fragcoord` the depth buffer holds 0.5 at
every sample point, the correct window z, so only the `gl_FragCoord.z` value
seen by the program reads 0.

## 12. Rules for a NIR-to-native backend

These rules are supported directly by the captures; the derived rules are
marked.

1. **Image and entries.** Put the fragment program(s) first and the vertex
   program(s) after, and bind raster and preprocessing `c3` to their entries.
   Emit the stop `ffff801c a01fc00f`; the clean-room probe measured that it
   ends a fragment program.  Never emit `fffc7e1d a2803f0f`.
2. **Varyings.** Interpolate each varying into temporaries with the
   `op2=0x10` template (a = 0x40+8k / 0x42+8k, b = 0x79, c = 0x44+8k /
   0x45+8k, `W1[3:0] = 8+k`).  Assign slots in fragment use order.  Keep six
   or fewer slots per raster pass; the vendor splits beyond that.
3. **Colour outputs.** Write colour to 0x2d with `op0=1d` (R,G) and `op0=1e`
   (B,A), covering both halves.
4. **Temporaries.** Use the vendor MOV forms: `W1[4]=0` single-scalar
   constant MOVs, `op0=1c`/`W1[4]=1` two-scalar copies.  Do not emit the
   lockup combination from section 2.
5. **Constants.** Build the fragment span as 8-byte entries.  Uniform vectors
   and matrix columns are xy/zw pairs, literal scalars `(v, v)`.  Append
   `(0, 1), (1, 0.5)`, and `(2.00000024, 1)` when compares are present.  Set
   `8c[14:8]` to the entry count and `8e - 8d = 8 * count`.
6. **Textures.** Bind them through the texture packets (`78/79/7a`, `7c`)
   and read texels from 0x00/0x02 (0x04/0x06).  A computed coordinate needs
   a preceding raster draw whose program writes 0x11/0x13 (DERIVED from the
   seven two-pass cases).
7. **Other forms.** Use the section 7 templates for discard, compare/select
   and loops, and the section 4 templates for arithmetic.  Compare every
   generated program against the fixture with
   `tools/m9-glsl-program-extract.py`.

## 13. Open items and exact follow-up captures

1. **Program bound without a stop slot.** Replay the vendor `fs-mul` image on
   the clean-room driver, first unchanged, then with a stop slot at 4 and the
   vertex program moved to 5.  Compare the readback and engine status.
2. **Varying routing.** Find the linker's VS-output-to-slot mapping (`6c`
   record, `23` declarations).  Capture a two-varying case with
   `v0 = u, v1 = w` written in the VS, and an FS writing `v0` to R,G and `v1`
   to B,A.  Run it once as declared and once with the varying declaration
   order swapped.  Dump the `6c` record at 0x200 bytes and the transient
   pre-pass output views (`m9-vendor-vram-dump.py --exec`) during the hold.
3. **cls 0 vs 4.** Draw `ff-color` and `fs-color` with an out-of-range colour
   (vertex colour from a uniform of 2.0 and -1.0) and compare readbacks.
4. **Signs and depth.** For the `dFdy` sign, capture `vec4(-dFdy(t)*64)`.
   For `gl_FragCoord.z`, capture geometry at z=0.5 with `glDepthRange(0.25,
   0.75)`.
5. **Fixed preprocessing entries.** Repeat `fs-color` at 64x64 and 256x256 to
   separate the viewport-dependent entries from constants.
6. **Operation semantics.** The operand roles of op2 0x02/0x0d/0x0e/0x11/
   0x13/0x1a are fixed only through the listed sequences.  Joining them to
   the lowerer corpus (`parhelia-m9-native-lower-runtime.md`) needs
   one-operation GLSL cases with a swizzle per operand.
