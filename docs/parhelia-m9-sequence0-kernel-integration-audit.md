# M9148 sequence-0 kernel integration audit

This note is the implementation contract for adding the captured first setup
submission to the guarded clean-room triangle diagnostic.  It audits saved
files and the current kernel source only; no command was sent to hardware.

Recheck the inputs, private framing, all relocation sites, scratch allocation
results, generated image, and current kernel capacity with:

```sh
python3 tools/m9-sequence0-kernel-audit.py
python3 tools/m9-sequence0-kernel-audit.py --generate /tmp/m9-seq0
python3 tools/m9-sequence0-kernel-audit.py --emit-c \
  > /tmp/m9-sequence0-framed.c
```

The generated directory contains an exact `secondary.bin`, its 36-byte
`primary.bin`, and a JSON manifest of every patched value.  The default
addresses are synthetic, valid addresses for offline checking only.

## Exact BmBuffer image and primary records

The captured BmBuffer begins with eight bytes of private host bookkeeping.
The first dword is the stale process value `0x006c57d8`; it is not submitted.
A clean-room image must zero bytes `[0,8)` and retain the captured bytes
`[8,fa0)` byte for byte before applying the typed patches below.

The three ExecuteDma ranges are end-exclusive:

| range | logical bytes | secondary bytes | packets | outer records | framed SHA-256 |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| 0 | `[000,538)` | `[008,540)` | 78 | 73 | `2eb4abba0035e593ba1d1f5b99e7df59199e886c4055ab0e51e603c6099d0779` |
| 1 | `[538,f6c)` | `[540,f74)` | 145 | 144 | `e082d94a4102b92ac743a18dc5e191be347a3eee1f5800091f6292cba1eb4dd7` |
| 2 | `[f6c,f98)` | `[f74,fa0)` | 3 | 3 | `a79c187e4e4e90438c9b80046b683d7df28e50d5f5e8119bcbf275069ba599ae` |

All 220 outer records are counted records.  Their count dwords remain in the
secondary image.  The verifier walks each count to the next exact record
boundary and pins a boundary-list hash for each range.  It also pins the
complete source BmBuffer as
`91854895140729c8dcb6ec55c511505241f3441be4bf5eea040fbea1ddfeeebd`.

For raw DMA address `S` of the coherent secondary BO, build exactly nine
primary dwords:

```text
45452d2c  (S+008)|1  (S+540)|2
45452d2c  (S+540)|1  (S+f74)|2
45452d2c  (S+f74)|1  (S+fa0)|2
```

Index `2c` receives the inclusive byte start with tag 1.  Index `2d` receives
the end-exclusive byte address with tag 2.  `S` is a raw DMA32 address, not a
`0x40000000` system-resource address.  Build all 36 primary bytes, execute
`dma_wmb()`, and publish one final endpoint.  Do not expose intermediate
12-byte or 24-byte endpoints.

## All 17 patches

Offsets below are absolute byte offsets in the framed `0xfa0`-byte secondary
image.  `T` is the first of nine consecutive 16-byte target values.

| range/dword | framed offset | index | replacement |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| 0/2 | `014` | `e3` | `T+00` |
| 0/23 | `084` | `e3` | `T+10` |
| 0/73 | `184` | `e3` | `T+10` |
| 1/2 | `54c` | `e3` | `T+20` |
| 1/18 | `5a0` | `e3` | `T+30` |
| 1/20 | `5ac` | `b0` | scratch 26 local address |
| 1/52 | `648` | `e3` | `T+30` |
| 1/383 | `cc0` | `e3` | `T+30` |
| 1/415 | `d74` | `e3` | `T+40` |
| 1/429 | `dbc` | `e3` | `T+50` |
| 1/431 | `dc8` | `b0` | scratch 27 local address |
| 1/466 | `e88` | `e3` | `T+60` |
| 1/480 | `ed0` | `e3` | `T+70` |
| 1/482 | `edc` | `b0` | scratch 38 local address |
| 2/1 | `f7c` | `1b` | coherent completion DMA address `|2` |
| 2/5 | `f90` | `e3` | `(T+80)|1` |
| 2/7 | `f9c` | `43` | `T+80` |

Every target and completion address has its low nibble cleared before the
listed tag is added.  The three local `b0` operands are untagged.  The
verifier rejects any other nonzero `e3`, `43`, `1b`, or matching scratch
`b0` value as an unclassified dynamic operand.

Reserve the target block atomically:

```text
used = T + {00,10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80} modulo 2^32
next = T + 90 modulo 2^32
```

Seed the completion dword so it cannot equal `T+80`, publish the secondary
and primary writes, then wait until `dma_rmb()` observes
`completion & ~0xf == T+80`.  Sequence 0 therefore consumes nine timeline
values, not one.  Keep the primary, secondary, completion page, and all three
scratch BOs pinned until that final value retires.

## Three local scratch objects

The allocation responses prove that all three operands are placement 4 local
VRAM objects in the M9148 `0x10000000..0x1fffffff` engine domain.  They are
not DMA32 coherent allocations.  For a pinned GEM VRAM object, patch
`0x10000000 + drm_gem_vram_offset()` into `b0`.

| vendor allocation | kind | captured base | usable bytes | dimensions | result `+21c/+220/+224` |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 26 | `10` | `11e19000` | `0800` | `1 x 1` | `80/20/20` |
| 27 | `01` | `11e21000` | `20080` | `2000 x 1` | `20000/80/2000` |
| 38 | `0e` | `11ed9000` | `0400` | `4 x 8` | `20/20/08` |

All three captured bases are 4-KiB aligned.  Preserve at least that allocator
granularity, the exact usable extents, and a guard page.  Keep the three BOs
distinct from one another and from the first-draw transients.

The result word at `+0x21c` has been called an allocation alignment in older
notes.  Allocation 27 rules out that interpretation for this record: its
returned base `0x11e21000` is not `0x20000` aligned.  Treat `+21c/+220/+224`
as pinned layout-result metadata until their private meanings are recovered;
do not request `0x20000` base alignment from `+21c`.

The capture contains allocation records but no pre-submit VRAM snapshots for
these objects.  It therefore cannot prove the vendor allocator's initial
bytes.  Sequence 0 only binds these three addresses as `b0` destinations and
does not bind them as source or texture operands.  Zero every usable byte in
the clean-room objects before first submission.  This gives deterministic
content and avoids making unknown allocator residue an input.  Retain the
objects for the diagnostic lifetime; freeing immediately at `T+80` would be
safe for command reachability, but later hidden context use has not been
excluded by a content capture.

This missing historical pre-content is not a sequence-0 publication blocker:
there is no captured command read from it, and deterministic zeroing supplies
the only unwritten bytes.  It remains a limitation on claiming byte-identical
vendor scratch output after completion.

## Delta against the current kernel diagnostic

At the time of this audit, `m9_triangle.c` declares a `0x4f0` secondary
payload with an eight-byte prefix.  It allocates every non-BE resource as
`PAGE_ALIGN(payload + PAGE_SIZE)`, so the current guarded secondary occupies
`0x2000` bytes:

```text
current:  PAGE_ALIGN(0x4f0 + 0x1000) = 0x2000
sequence: PAGE_ALIGN(0xfa0 + 0x1000) = 0x2000
```

Increase the usable secondary payload and move its guard start from `0x4f0`
to `0xfa0`.  The underlying allocation does not grow.  Reusing the existing
buffer without moving the guard would overwrite the current sentinel region.
Its `u32 primary[9]` already has the required 36-byte capacity.

Add three local resource identities with usable sizes `0x800`, `0x20080`,
and `0x400`; the existing four `0x16800` first-draw transients are not matching
substitutes.  Add a sequence-0 framed template and its independent 17-entry
patch table.  Run sequence 0 after guarded cold engine/requester/window setup
and before constructing or publishing the captured triangle.  Advance the
shared fence allocator by nine values for setup and by the draw's own six
values afterward.

The exact setup publication has no remaining offline transport blocker.
Hardware execution still depends on the parent work that publishes the local
and system address windows/page table and passes the existing cold-init and
no-op diagnostics.  A hang after those prerequisites would be a hardware
isolation result rather than missing BmBuffer, relocation, scratch, or primary
framing information.
