# Matrox M9 requester rollover and the `0x404` doorbell

This note separates two register interfaces which use related command-buffer
addresses but are not one ring descriptor.  Evidence comes from the saved
Linux `KernelLibraries.o_shipped` and Windows `MxMM.sys`; addresses below are
ELF text offsets or PE virtual addresses.  `[BIN]` denotes direct disassembly
evidence and `[DER]` its narrow consequence.  No hardware was used.

## `0x404` is an endpoint doorbell, not a limit

Linux `m9x109` at `0x2d150..0x2d1bd` translates the command object's CPU start
pointer, stores the resulting GPU address in the primary allocation object at
`+0x50`, clears its low two bits, adds the backing class from resource `+0x34`,
and writes the result to MMIO `0x400` [BIN].  At submission, `m9x1039`
`0x2d7d7..0x2d83f` translates the final CPU producer, stores that endpoint in
the same `+0x50`, and writes it to MMIO `0x404` [BIN].  Thus the two registers
are a tagged start/control value and a final executable address.  There is no
length or upper-bound value written to `0x404` [DER].

The compare immediately before the Linux doorbell is software allocation
bookkeeping, not an address comparison [BIN]:

```
primary = command->allocator->primary       // command +48, allocator +10
primary->submitted_endpoint = translate(command->producer) // primary +50
if (primary->active_nodes <= command->node_allowance)
        MMIO[0x404] = primary->submitted_endpoint;
command->node_allowance = 0;
```

The field names describe only the demonstrated roles. `m9x669` initializes
the primary object's `+0x54` to zero, and allocation methods `m9x110` and
`m9x599` increment it once per node linked into the circular list rooted at
`+0x68`; teardown methods return it to zero.  The command constructors
`m9x654` and `m9x1086` initialize command `+0x58` to zero, and `m9x1039`
clears it after the comparison.  The saved ELF has no direct nonzero
immediate-displacement store to this command field.  Static evidence does not
identify the path, if any, that grants a nonzero node allowance.  A new driver
must not translate this comparison into a hardware ring-size rule [DER].

Windows independently fixes the endpoint meaning without this Linux-only
allocator policy.  `MxMM.sys` `0x224c8` copies CPU start to current producer
and writes object `+0x24` to MMIO `0x400`.  Function `0x224f3` computes
`current_producer - cpu_start + gpu_base` from object `+0x2c/+0x20/+0x24` and
writes exactly that address to `0x404` [BIN].  It performs no access to
`0x500..0x524` and no size comparison.

## The `0x500..0x524` requester rolls independently

The requester descriptor's software-owned words have a different producer
chain [BIN]:

- Linux `m9x759` `0x2b290..0x2b380` writes a tagged transition/base address to
  `0x500`, zero to `0x508`, and the raw live pointer to `0x504`.
- Linux `m9x620` `0x285d0..0x28799` appends either a 16-byte or 32-byte
  descriptor record when required, then publishes the translated software
  producer through `0x504`.
- Linux `m9x1200` `0x2b1c0..0x2b27a` publishes and quiesces, writes the
  two-dword transition record `{2, resource_gpu_base}`, resets the software
  start/producer and end guard to that resource's CPU mapping, republishes
  `0x504`, and quiesces again.
- The Windows equivalents `0x145a5` and `0x146bc` derive `0x500/0x504` from
  their requester object's aligned start, CPU mapping and GPU base.  They do
  not access `0x400/0x404`.

Neither rollover path writes `0x404`, and neither `0x404` submitter reads or
writes the descriptor words.  The only demonstrated relationship is that both
interfaces carry GPU addresses belonging to command transport [DER].  In
particular, `0x50c/0x510` cannot be named as mirrors or limits of `0x404`.

## Field ownership, including first use

The complete literal-MMIO census supports the following names without
inventing the undocumented internal pipeline [BIN]:

| register | software operation | narrow role |
|---:|---|---|
| `0x500` | seeded with a tagged address; thereafter only read or restored | tagged requester progress/base word |
| `0x504` | repeatedly written with the raw translated producer | published producer endpoint |
| `0x508` | initialized to zero; bit 1 is set before save; bit 0 is polled | requester control/status (`bit 0 = quiescent`, `bit 1 = park` [DER]) |
| `0x50c` | polled with `0x500`; otherwise only read or restored | hardware progress companion, exact direction unknown |
| `0x510` | only read or restored | address-like saved companion, exact direction unknown |
| `0x514` | only read or restored with `0x50c/0x510` | opaque companion state |
| `0x520/0x524` | only read or restored, always restored first | opaque pair |

`0x500` is more specific than a static base: after initialization no software
path advances it, while both vendor quiescence loops require two stable samples
of it.  Calling it a hardware consumer pointer would still overstate the
evidence because no saved capture shows its direction.  `0x504`, by contrast,
has an unambiguous software producer and is the ring tail exposed to hardware.

Windows gives an exact first-use sequence.  Constructor `0x14463` installs the
sole rollover method `0x14540`, clears the saved eight-word image, selects
four-byte stream alignment, and leaves the requester inactive.  `0x14633`
then obtains the per-device requester at device `+0xc238`; on its first use it
allocates exactly one `0x1000`-byte block through `0x14aa9`, whose private
allocation selector is `2`.  Attach helper `0x144d9` maps selector 2 through
the table `{2,3,0,3}`, hence this saved build initializes requester tag
`+0x64` to zero, initializes the embedded software stream, and calls `0x145a5`.
That call orders the first hardware writes as `0x500`, `0x508=0`, `0x504`.
Later acquisitions reuse the page and repeat initialization only when the
per-device requester state at `+0x1a60` is not `2` [BIN].  Selector 2 is an
internal allocation selector; this sequence does not give it a public Linux
memory-type name.

There is no hidden priming record on first use.  The initial `0x500` address is
the aligned-tail formula already documented below and the initial `0x504`
value is the same formula without the tag.  Records enter the page only through
the ordinary software-stream writers.  If a write does not fit, the stream's
sole virtual method invokes `0x14540`, which publishes and quiesces, appends
`{2, allocation_gpu_base}`, resets the stream, publishes the new `0x504`, and
quiesces again [BIN].

The producer/consumer census is closed for the saved binaries.  Windows has
one additional read-only diagnostic path, `0x125fa` (`0x12d4b..0x12ded`),
which copies all eight requester dwords verbatim into a diagnostic record.
It derives no fields.  Linux has only `m9x759`, `m9x620`, `m9x1016`, `m9x399`,
and `m9x714` as literal requester-register users; Windows has only the
initializer/publisher/quiescence/save/restore family plus that diagnostic
snapshot.  The sixteen saved X-server `m9x_drv.so` variants contain no kernel
MMIO producer for this bank and all use the same shipped kernel object [BIN].

The exhaustive direct-register audit remains the static boundary for the five
hardware-owned descriptor words: outside restore, neither saved kernel binary
has a software write to `0x50c`, `0x510`, `0x514`, `0x520`, or `0x524`.
Quiescence samples `0x500` and `0x50c`; save/restore preserves all eight words;
Windows conditionally restores the `50c/514/510` triple when
`(saved_50c ^ saved_510) & ~0xf` is nonzero.  These facts show address-like
tagging and rollover-sensitive state, but do not reveal which word is a fetch
pointer, boundary, or pending transition [DER].

## Smallest capture that resolves the remaining fields

Instrument MMIO reads/writes and force exactly one `m9x1200` requester wrap
with a fence after it.  Four timestamped samples are sufficient:

1. quiescent state before the final pre-wrap descriptor;
2. immediately after its `0x504` publication;
3. immediately after the transition record and post-wrap `0x504` publication;
4. quiescent state after the fence retires.

Each sample must contain `0x400`, the most recent value written to `0x404`, all
eight words `0x500..0x524`, the software CPU start/producer/end-guard pointers,
the backing GPU base/class, and the two dwords at the old-ring transition
record.  Record the two `0x504` writes and any `0x404` write in order.  A single
wrap distinguishes stable limits from moving fetch/current pointers; the
pre-publication and post-fence samples distinguish software publication from
hardware consumption.  No rendering workload or second wrap is needed unless
the first wrap leaves `0x50c` equal to `0x510`; in that case repeat once with
the ring base chosen across a different low-nibble tag boundary.

Until that capture, preserve `0x50c..0x524` as opaque saved hardware state and
keep requester rollover separate from construction of the `0x404` endpoint.
