# M9 texture coordinates: what the hardware can sample at, and what a
# shader that computes its coordinate needs

The M9 raster engine performs the texture fetch itself, at a coordinate it
interpolates, one per bound unit: the fragment program never issues a read,
it only reads the texel register the engine filled.  That is why the m9x
backend refuses `texture coordinate is not a varying`.  This note separates
the shaders that can be made to work from the ones that cannot, so neither is
chased in the wrong direction.  Written September 17, 2026 from the glmark2
shaders on the target and from the corpus in `m9_fs_corpus.h`.

## What the engine does (CAPTURED)

Each unit has a declaration entry — `0x00500d88`, `0x00600d88`, `0x00700d88`
for the first three — naming the varying it interpolates, and the program
addresses its result as a texel register pair.  Nothing in the 182-shader
corpus samples at anything but an interpolated varying, and there is no
instruction that takes a coordinate operand.  `glamor/xv-planar-3` binds
**three** units (r88 bit 22 set, three declarations), so the driver's
`M9_FS_MAX_TEXTURES` of 2 is a driver limit, not the hardware's; how far above
three it goes is not established.

## The case that can be made to work: an affine coordinate

Interpolation is linear, so for a coordinate that is an affine function of
varyings with per-draw coefficients,

    interp(A * v + b) == A * interp(v) + b

and the driver can compute `A * v + b` per vertex on the CPU and hand it to
the engine as an ordinary varying.  The result is exact, not an approximation:
the engine interpolates a different varying, and samples at precisely the
coordinate the shader asked for.

The vertex stage already runs on the CPU in the Gallium draw module, and the
context already carries driver-synthesised per-vertex varyings (`struct
m9_context::extra`, "float4 CPU varyings per source record"), so the machinery
exists.  What is needed is for the fragment backend to recognise the affine
form, record the transform, and for the draw path to emit the extra varying.

**However, the interpolation budget rules both of the scenes below out**, and
that was established after this note was first written.  The raster pass has
six stream slots and keeps three for position, c and d, so a shader may
interpolate **three** streams in total, counting each distinct texture
coordinate.  Scanning the declarations of all 182 captured programs, the
highest stream index the vendor ever declares is 4 -- five streams, i.e. two
usable -- so three is already at or above anything the captures support.
jellyfish needs five (two coordinates plus vDiffuse, vAmbient, vFresnel) and
bump-height needs six (three coordinates plus NormalEye, TangentEye,
BitangentEye).  The folding below is implemented and measured, and it is what
a shader sampling at a computed offset needs, but only while that shader
stays inside three interpolated streams.

glmark2's **jellyfish** has exactly the coordinate shape this note is about,
even though its varying count puts it out of reach:

    texture2D(uSampler1, vec2(vWorld.x / 24.0 + uCurrentTime / 20.0,
                              (vWorld.z - vWorld.y) / 48.0 + uCurrentTime / 40.0))

— two varying components combined with uniform coefficients.  It binds two
units, so it needs no new unit either.

**bump-height** is the same shape, and needs three units -- but six
interpolated streams, so it is out of reach for that reason:

    texture2D(HeightMap, TextureCoord)
    texture2D(HeightMap, TextureCoord + vec2(TextureStepX, 0.0))
    texture2D(HeightMap, TextureCoord + vec2(0.0, TextureStepY))

Three fetches of one image at three uniform offsets: three declarations, three
varyings, one image bound three times.  Feasible once the unit count is raised
and the affine fold is in.

## The cases that need more than one pass

A convolution samples one image at many offsets, and every sample costs a
unit, because a unit is what carries a coordinate.  There is no dependent
read to fall back on.

| scene | fetches of one image | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| effect2d, 3x3 kernel | 9 | three passes |
| effect2d, 5x5 kernel | 25 | nine passes |
| desktop, blur radius 5 separable | 11 per pass | four passes each |
| terrain | 6 distinct samplers, plus computed coordinates | two passes |
| jellyfish | 2 fetches, but 5 interpolated streams | within reach |
| bump-height | 3 fetches of one image at uniform offsets | compiles |

**Corrected September 17, 2026.**  The counts are right, the verdicts were
not.  The vendor renders such a shader in several framebuffer passes, to a
scratch surface bound back through index `78`, one pass per three further
application textures (`parhelia-m9-openbits-gl-capture.md` section 2,
CAPTURED up to sixteen samplers).  These scenes are therefore out of reach of
a *single* pass, and what they need is multi-pass scheduling in the driver,
which is not implemented.  What is implemented is sharing -- fetches that
agree in sampler and coordinate take one unit -- and four independent fetches
in one pass, which is what `bump-height` needs
(`parhelia-m9-mesa-depth-textures.md` section 1).

The desktop blur scene still runs and is still worth optimising — it draws
its windows, and only the blur passes are refused — but its windows will not
be blurred until that schedule is in.

## Implementation sketch

1. In `build_tex`, accept a coordinate whose two components are each
   `fadd(fmul(varying_component, uniform_or_literal), uniform_or_literal)`,
   or any subset of that, and record per unit: the source varying location
   and components, and where the four coefficients come from.
2. Extend `struct m9_fs_program`'s per-unit texcoord description with that
   transform, defaulting to the identity so nothing else changes.
3. In the draw path, when a unit's transform is not the identity, emit the
   transformed coordinate as one of the CPU varyings the context already
   synthesises, and point the unit's declaration at it.
4. Raise `M9_FS_MAX_TEXTURES` to the number of units the declaration form
   supports, which needs the third and any further declaration words
   confirmed against `glamor/xv-planar-3` and the captures.

Steps 1 to 4 are done: `M9_FS_MAX_TEXTURES` is four, the limit one pass has,
and the fixture is `m9-mesa-glsl texaff`.

A fixture should go in first: sample one image twice, once at a varying and
once at that varying times a uniform plus a uniform offset, against a CPU
reference that computes the same two texels.
