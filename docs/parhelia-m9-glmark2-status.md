# glmark2 on the m9x driver: where the 60 fps goal actually stands

**MEASURED 2026-09-18** at 1920x1200 on the dual-DisplayPort M9128 (subsystem
102b:22c0, 1 GiB VRAM) in the 16 GB host, one head driven, stock X server with
the image's glamor, Mesa built with LLVM JIT (`draw-use-llvm`).

Measured with `tools/m9x-glmark-sweep.sh` and `tools/m9x-glmark-parse.awk`.
The parser refuses to count a scene whose draws the driver skipped, whose job
lost its context, or whose stream timed out - each of those reports a very high
frame rate precisely because nothing was drawn.  It annotates rather than
invalidates a scene that fell back off a hardware path, because such a scene
does draw.  A fault raised *after* the last scene's result is charged to the
run, since submission is asynchronous and the error surfaces later than the job
that caused it.

Sweep one scene per process: glmark2 segfaults (rc=139, client-side, no stream
timeout) moving from the 15-tap `effect2d` scene to `shadow` within one
process, and `shadow` run alone is 142 fps.

Every run asserts `GL_RENDERER` is `Matrox M9`: a Mesa build configured without
`--cross-file cross-t2-llvm.ini` links against the host libdrm and X, EGL falls
back to llvmpipe silently, and every fixture still passes against the CPU
reference.

## The scenes that were blocked

All but one now render.  They were blocked on one feature - the fragment
multipass path - and on three defects found while implementing it.

| scene | rate | state |
|---|---|---|
| `effect2d` default (1 tap, no split) | 222-231 fps | renders |
| `effect2d` 3x3 kernel (2 passes) | 86-89 fps | renders |
| `effect2d` 15-tap (5 passes) | 25-33 fps | renders, with a 141 MiB record |
| `shadow` | 143-147 fps | renders |
| `refract` (4 passes) | 1 fps at 1920x1200, 2 at 640x480 | renders |
| `terrain` | - | scene renders; `terrain.frag` refused for register pressure, and the policy that compiles it hits the scene-scale stall below |
| `desktop` separable blur (4 passes) | - | stops the engine on the first frame |

The rest of the suite was already above 60 fps and is unchanged; the slowest
were `function medium` 62, `shading cel` 70, `shading phong` 87.

## Three of these cannot reach 60 fps, and that is the fill rate

`parhelia-m9-fill-rate.md` measures one full-screen fragment operation at
**1.157 ms** per 1920x1200 screen, linear across `alu0..alu16`.  A 60 fps frame
therefore holds **14.4** such operations.

| scene | full-screen operations | ceiling |
|---|---:|---:|
| `effect2d` 15-tap | ~19 | ~46 fps |
| `terrain` tilt-shift pair | ~18 | ~50 fps |
| `desktop` 11-tap separable blur over composited windows | ~23 | ~43 fps |

These are not failures and no scheduling reaches 60 fps on them at this size.
Correct rendering at an honest rate is the deliverable.  `refract`'s 1 fps is
likewise fill-bound: its distance target is the canvas at 2x and its shader
takes four passes.

## What was actually wrong, in the order it was found

Each was closed from the working side - take a passing fixture, add one
property at a time until it fails - which beat every attempt to reason from the
command stream.

1. **Index `ef` bits 10:9** carry a raster pass's place in a multi-pass
   sequence (0 only, 1 first, 2 middle, 3 last).  The driver emitted zero,
   telling the engine every pass was a complete draw, so the inter-pass record
   never bound.  CAPTURED: single-pass draws `00000000`; every two-pass case
   `00000200` then `00000600`; the five-sampler schedule
   `00000200 00000400 00000400 00000400 00000600`.
2. **A producing pass's root went to the colour output `0x2d`** instead of the
   destination `encode_lops` computes, so it was packed into the render
   target's pixel format.  A shader whose root arrives through arithmetic
   worked all along; one whose root arrives through a plain move did not.
3. **Depth must be evaluated in the first raster pass only.**  The passes of a
   split shader are one fragment pipeline in sequence and those behind inherit
   the coverage.  Restating the test in a continuation pass stops the engine -
   which is why every *windowed* scene with a splitting shader stalled, since a
   window carries a depth attachment whether the scene tests against it or not.
4. **Index `88` bits 15:4 flag register pairs the program leaves unused, and a
   pair flagged unused is one the engine reuses.**  A four-unit pass reads a
   texel out of `0x0e`, which the backend was declaring free.  Reproduced with
   single-pass fixtures, no split involved: `texhi:4:0` wrong in 37822 of
   76800 pixels, every other unit exact.
5. **Three unjustified constants**, each replaced by the real bound rather than
   raised: a 128-relocation cap (the real bound is the command image's word
   count), a fixed batch relocation array, and a 32 MiB BO size cap applied to
   every memory class.  `M9_VRAM_GPU_SIZE` was deleted outright - it matched
   BAR0's length rather than any hardware limit, and four clamps compared
   engine addresses against the aperture instead of the memory.

6. **The engine keeps per-target state in the object bound at index `be`.**
   A split draw returning to an earlier render-target shape read the state a
   target of another shape had left there, and the engine stopped.  Fixed with
   one `be` object per render-target shape, allocated beside the depth and HZ
   pair.

   The decisive evidence was CAPTURED rather than reasoned: dumping the stream
   over `splitpair:84x84:320x240:3` shows the stalling third draw's two
   submissions are **byte for byte identical** to the first draw's - command
   dwords, relocations and BO list all equal.  Nothing the driver emitted
   separated the draw that renders from the draw that stops the engine, which
   is what turned the search towards state the engine carries between jobs.
   Against the rendering `88x88` case the only differing dword in the entire
   stream is the clip/scissor word.  Dumping `be` after each job then showed
   the engine writing a mask over the first 16 KiB whose extent is
   proportional to the target's area - 306 dwords for 84x84, 334 for 88x88,
   3149 for 320x240, always contiguous from offset 0.

   Two negatives worth keeping: one `be` per *colour resource* stalls where one
   per *shape* passes, so the engine wants sharing by shape rather than
   per-surface isolation; and clearing `be` every job passes at 3 draws and
   stalls at 20, which is exactly why the probes use 20 draws - a rare event
   must not be able to hide.

## What still stalls

`desktop` and `terrain` (with `M9X_SPLIT_PRESSURE=1`) still stop the engine
with `two-pass job failed (Input/output error); context lost`, on an
attributable build under the hardware lock, **after** the `be` fix.  So they
carry a second, distinct fault in the split path **at scene scale** that the
fixture family does not reach: every `splitpair` and `deskblur` fixture passes.
Raising the per-shape cache budget so nothing is evicted does not change it.

`desktop` faults on the **first frame** of `glmark2 -b desktop --size
1920x1200`.  The untested scene-scale properties are a split draw into a target
far larger than 320x240, and the number of simultaneously live shapes - neither
of which the fixtures reach.

Because `terrain` needs `M9X_SPLIT_PRESSURE` and that path hits this fault, the
register-pressure policy stays off by default and `terrain.frag` stays refused.

## Readings this retires

* `effect2d` at 640x480 rendering clean does **not** refute the 3x3 kernel
  stalling there: the default kernel is one tap and never splits.  Two agents
  reported those as contradictory results for the same scene.
* `refract` was reported as stalling.  It does not - it had simply never been
  measured, and completes with no timeout, no skipped draws and no lost
  context.
* `desktop`'s 37 fps was never the 4-pass path: its log showed the 106 MiB
  record refused thirteen times, so that number was the fallback.
* Fixing the `be` per-shape stall was expected to close `desktop` and
  `terrain`.  It did not - both still stop the engine, which is how the second
  scene-scale fault was found.
* `jellyfish` and `ideas` are 117 and 108 fps here; their 1 fps on the 481 MB
  host was host memory, not a driver defect.
